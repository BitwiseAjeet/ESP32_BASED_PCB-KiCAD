# ESP32_BASED_PCB-KiCAD
This project involved the end-to-end design and development of a compact, low-power IoT system using the ESP32-C3-02 SoC and integrated TP4056 Li-ion battery charger. The goal was to create a reliable and modular platform for wireless environmental data monitoring, powered by a rechargeable battery with onboard protection and USB-C support.
